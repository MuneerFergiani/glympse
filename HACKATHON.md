# Glimpse: Elevating Academic Integrity Through the Noir ZK Language

**Bounty Track:** Best Noir Application or Library.
**Authors:** Arbion Halili, Muneer Fergiana and Andrei Cravtov.

The landscape of academia is increasingly shadowed by instances of data fraud, as epitomized by cases like the discredited MMR vaccine study. Traditional peer reviews, though invaluable, occasionally miss nuanced manipulations. Recognizing this, we present Glimpse, a tool underpinned by the Noir ZK language to revolutionize data integrity in research.

## The Central Challenges Addressed by Glimpse via Noir

1. _Improper Provenance Authentication_: Noir's capabilities are utilized to counteract fake data and tampering.
2. _Imperfect Participant and Data Secrecy_: The ZK properties of Noir combat potential bribery, pressure, and collusion.
3. _Retrospective Methodology Tampering_: Noir's cryptographic strengths assist in preventing data omission, p-hacking, and data dredging.

## How It Works

## How Noir Powers Glimpse

Glimpse, leveraging Noir, crafts verifiable pseudonymous cryptographic identities on the blockchain. This robust mechanism ensures unyielding data provenance and guarantees participant anonymity. Responses are encrypted, safeguarding them from undue alterations. Data decryption relies on a collaborative n-of-n threshold decryption, only after full participation. The enforced preliminary declaration of research methodologies, enabled through Noir's functionalities, mitigates issues like p-hacking.

## Limitations

Glimpse, although groundbreaking in its use of the Noir language, has its challenges. It currently doesn’t employ a full-fledged EdDSA, has certain inefficiencies in smart-contract generation, and offers only binary response options. The system's human validation relies on a basic whitelist, and there's an absence of differential privacy. Nonetheless, Glimpse's potential, rooted in Noir's prowess, heralds a new era of reinforced academic data integrity with refinements on the anvil.
